Small NES Emulator.
## Why???
I want to make a NES emulator in many forms.
## Progress
* Subset of the 6502 instructions
* No NES hardware
* Runs a basic snake game from [Easy 6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/#snake)
## Ports
* Original PC port. Up-to-date (`pc/`)
* HLSL Shader for VRChat. WIP (`vrchlsl/`)
